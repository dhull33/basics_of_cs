#Consider the following assessment criteria which map a score out of 100 to an assessment grade:
#Grade	Raw score (/100)

#Excellent	 ≥82
#Very good	 ≥76.5 and  <82
#Good	 ≥66 a nd  <76.5
#Need improvement	 ≥44 and  <66
#Did you try?	 <45
 
#Write a program that asks for the input score and prints the appropriate grade. Print an error message if the input score is #greater than 100 or less than zero.
#Recall that
  # Get input from user
    #number = float(input('How many seconds in one minute? '))
    #can be used for interactive input. 
    
    
    
 grade = float(input("What was your grade? "))

if grade >= 45 and grade < 66:
    print("Need Improvement")
elif grade >=66 and grade < 76.5: 
    print("Good")
elif grade >= 76.5 and grade < 82:
    print("Very Good")
elif grade >= 82 and grade <=100:
    print("Excellent")
elif grade > 100:
    print("Error")
else:
    print("Did you try?")
