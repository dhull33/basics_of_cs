#### Structure of a Function ####



1. A function is declared using "def" followed by the name of the function (you can call it anything), which is then followed
   by the list of arguments you want the function to have and then its ended with a colon. For example:
      
                def main(x, y, z): 
              
            This creates a function called "main" and has to be given the three variables x, y, z, in order
            to run. Otherwise you will get an error term.
            
2. After 1, the body of the function comes next. The body of the function is the meat and potatoes of the function if you      
   if you will. It is the operations you want to run. For exaple if you wanted to add two integers together we would use                
   something like this: "return a + b" , where a and b are integers. 


3. So putting it all together we have: 
        
        def add_2ints (a, b):
            return a + b


#### Purpose of Functions  ####
Functions allow computer code to be re-used multiple times with different input data. It is good to re-use code as much as possible because we then focus testing and debugging efforts, and maybe also optimisations, on small pieces of code that are then re-used. The more code that is written, the less frequently sections of code are used, and as a consequence the greater the likelihood of errors.
Functions can also enhance the readability of a program, and make it easier to collaborate with others. Functions allow us to focus on what a program does at a high level rather than the details of how it does it. Low-level implementation details are encapsulated in functions. To understand at a high level what a program does, we usually just need to know what data is passed into a function and what the function returns. It is not necessary to know the precise details of how a function is implemented to grasp the structure of a program and how it works. For example, we might need to know that a function computes and returns  sin(x)
 ; we don't usually need to know how it computes sine.
 
 ### Function Arguments ####
The order in which function arguments are listed ibn the dfunction declaration is in general the order in which arguments         should be passed to a function 

For more com[;ocated functions we mught have numerous arguments. Consequently, it becomes easier to get the wrong order by accident when calliung thge fucntion (which results in a bug). In python, we can reduce the likelihood of an error by using named arguments, in which case order will not matter. 


Function Arguments:
Many object types can be passed as arguments to functions, including other functions. 

Default Arguments:
Sometimes it is useful to have 'default' argument values which can be overridden. 


### Recursion with Functions ###
A classic construction with function is recursion, which is when a function makes calls to itself. Recursion can be very powerful, and sometimes also quite confusing at first.
