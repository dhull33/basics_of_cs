Bisection is an iterative method for approximating roots of a function. Say we know that the function  f(x)
  has one root between  x0
  and  x1
  ( x0<x1
 ). We then:
Evaluate  f
  at the midpoint  xmid=(x0+x1)/2
 , i.e. compute  fmid=f(xmid)
 
Evaluate  f(x0)⋅f(xmid)
 
If  f(x0)⋅f(xmid)<0
 :
f
  must change sign somewhere between  x0
  and  xmid
 , hence the root must lie between  x0
  and  xmid
 , so set  x1=xmid
 .
Else
f
  must change sign somewhere between  xmid
  and  x1
 , so set  x0=xmid
 .
The above steps can be repeated a specified number of times, or until  |fmid|
  is below a tolerance, with  xmid
  being the approximate root.
Task: The function
f(x)=x3−6x2+4x+12

d
 
has one root somewhere between  x0=3
  and  x1=6
 .
Use the bisection method to find an approximate root  xr
  using 15 iterations (use a for loop).
Use the bisection method to find an approximate root  xr
  such that  ||f(xr)||<1×10−6
  and report the number of iterations required (use a while loop).
Hint: Use  abs to compute the absolute value of a number, e.g. y = abs(x) assigns the absolute value of x to y.


###using a "for" loop###


def fun (x):
    f = (x**3) - (6*x**2) + (4*x) + (12)
    return(f)
()
    

x_0 = 3
x_1 = 6


for i in range(15): 
    x_mid = (x_0 + x_1)/2
    f_0 = fun(x_0)
    f_mid = fun(x_mid)
    
    if (f_0*f_mid) < 0.0:
        x_1 = x_mid
    else:
        x_0 = x_mid
    print(i, x_mid, f_mid)
    
    
###using a while loop###

def fun (x):
    f = (x**3) - (6*x**2) + (4*x) + (12)
    return(f)

tolerance = 1.0e-6
error = tolerance + 1 

x_0 = 3
x_1 = 6
counter = 0

while error > tolerance:
    x_mid = (x_0 + x_1) / 2 
    f_0 = fun(x_0)
    f_mid = fun(x_mid)
    
    if (f_0*f_mid) < 0.0:
        x_1 = x_mid
    else: 
        x_0 = x_mid
    
    error = abs(f_mid)
    counter += 1
    print(counter, x_mid, f_mid)
